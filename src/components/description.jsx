              <hr />
              <p>
                My name is Xingya Ren, and I usually go by the name Annie, due
                to the fact that my first name is too hard to be pronunced üòÇüôà.
                (It's "Hsing-yah", btw.)
                <br />
                I'm currently studying software engineering at McGill University
                and will graduate next year in May. While being interested in
                both sciences and liberal arts, I find programming to be an
                excellent balance between creative freedom and realistic limits.
                According to
                <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/"> 16Personalities</a>,
                I am 44% extraverted and 56% introverted. Just wanted to include
                this to make my self-introduction a bit analytical :)
